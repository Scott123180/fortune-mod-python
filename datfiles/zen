Imagine two waves, a smaller one and a larger one, travelling across the ocean. Suddenly, the larger waves sees land approaching, and gets upset. He cries to the smaller wave, "Oh no! Up ahead - waves are crashing and disappearing! We're going to die!" The smaller wave, somehow, is unperturbed. So the larger wave tries to convince her, to no avail. Finally the smaller wave says, "What would you say if I told you that there are six words, that if you really understood and believed them, you would see that there's no reason to fear." The bigger wave protests, but as the land approaches, he becomes desperate. He'll try anything. "Fine, fine, tell me the six words." 

"Okay," the smaller wave says. "You're not a wave, you're water."

Then it is my turn.

Even if I replied, they would not understand.

Most of our difficulties, our hopes and our worries are empty fantasies. Nothing has ever existed except this moment. That's all there is. That's all we are.

We think about what has happened to us, what might have happened, how we feel about it, how we should be different, how others should be different, how it's all a shame, and on and on; it's all fantasy, all imagination. Memory is imagination. Every memory that we stick to devastates our life.

The True Man of ancient times knew nothing of loving life, knew nothing of hating death. He emerged without delight; he went back in without a fuss. He came briskly, he went briskly, and that was all. He didn't forget where he began; he didn't try to find out where he would end. He received something and took pleasure in it; he forgot about it and handed it back again. This is what I call not using the mind to repel the Way, not using man to help out Heaven.

Lung-ya asked the master, Te-shan, "If I threatened to cut your head off with the sharpest sword I could find, what would you do?"

The master pulled his head in.
Lung-ya said, "Your head is off!"
Later, Lung-ya came to Tung-shan and told of this episode.

Tung-shan asked, "What did Te-shan say?"

Lung-ya: "He said nothing!"
Tung-shan replied: "He said nothing? Then show me the head you cut off!"

Lung-ya acknowledged his fault and apologized. Later, someone reported the story back to Te-shan, who remarked, "Old Tung-shan has no judgement. That Lung-ya had been dead for some time - what is the use of trying to save him?"

Most people insist on some idea. Recently the younger generation talks about love. Love! Love! Love! Their minds are full of love! And when they study Zen, if what I say does not accord with the idea they have of love, they will not accept it. They are quite stubborn, you know. You may be amazed! Of course, not all, but some have a very, very hard attitude. That is not naturalness at all. Even though they talk about love, and freedom, or naturalness, they do not understand these things . And they cannot understand what Zen is in that way. If you want to study Zen, you should forget all your previous ideas and just practice zazen and see what kind of experience you have in your practice. That is naturalness.

I have found it helpful merely to *listen* to the breath, as the Zen-trained teacher Toni Packer advises, rather than employ an alalytic method. In the same spirit, one can view oneself not as the owner/operator of one's breathing but as the one "being breathed," both by one's body and by the life force common to all living beings. Approached in this way, the breath becomes an object of interest rather than willful concentration.

Use what you have, use what the world gives you. Use the first day of fall: bright flame before winter's deadness; harvest; orange, gold, amber; cool nights and the smell of fire.

Self-inquiry is simple. It only asks you to pay careful attention to what is true and real.

I have two songs. When they were about four, they both went through a phase of having nightmares. I would go into the room. Two small eyes blinked at me from the corner.

"What's the problem?" I'd ask.

"Daddy, there's a monster in the room." Now, I had more than one choice of how to respond... but the only real solution I ever found was to have a good look. Under the bed, in the closet, behind the curtains.

Eventually my sons would let out a deep sigh, smile at me, and fall back to sleep. The problem was not solved, but dissolved. It was never real in the first place, but it took investigation to make it a reality.

Practicing spiritualaity brings a sense of perspective, meaning, and purpose to our lives.

The lesson which life repeats and constantly enforces is "look under foot." You are always nearer the divine and the true sources of your power than you think. The lure of the distant and difficult is deceptive. The great opportunity is where you are. Do not despise your own place and hour. Every place is under the stars, every place is of the world.

The naked moment is the only guide that we need to relax our mind. We need to trust this: in the midst of our daily life activities, the possibility to slow down, to stop, and then to appreciate naturally unfolds. For a fleeting moment we pause and note the sunlight on the sheets as we make the bed, note the warm sun on our cup as we sip tea, or note the fading light on the curtain as we enter the room. And we let out a breath or sigh. Pausing.

Annie Dillard once wrote, "How we sepnd our days is, of course, how we spend our lives. What we do with this hour, and that one, is what we are doing." I think about this a lot when I'm planning my day and what sort of pleasure I might suck out of its marrow during these tumultuous times of constant upheaval and war. Sometimes that means noticing event the most mundane of tasks in order to know we are alive, that we are living.

What I am really saying is that you don't need to do anything, because if you see yourself in the correct way, you are all as much extraordinary phenomena of nature as trees, clouds, the patterns in running water, the flickering of fire, the arrangement of the stars, and the form of a galaxy. You are all just like that, and there is nothing wrong with you at all.

We must be able to let things happen in the psyche. For us, this is an art of which most people know nothing. Consciousness is forever interfering, helping, correcting, and negating, never leaving the psychic process to grow in peace. It would be simple enough, if only simplicity were not the most difficult of all things.

When you go to Riverside Drive and sit beside the Hudson River, your thoughts come and go like sailing boats. Finally, they go away-the mind becomes blank- and you do not see the sailing boats.

Then "Oh!" and you come back.

Somewhere in this process, you will come face-to-face with the sudden and shocking realization that you are completely crazy. Your mind is a shrieking, gibbering madhouse on wheels baralling pell-mell down the hill, utterly out of control and hopeless. No problem... Ignorance may be bliss, but it does not lead to liberation. So don't let this realization unsettle you. It is acually a sign of real progress.

Death is our eternal companion... It is always to our left, at an arm's length... It has always been watching you. It always will until the day it taps you.

The thing to do when you're impatient is.. to turn to your left and ask advice from your death. An immense amount of pettiness is dropped if your death makes a gesture to you, or if you catch a glimpse of it, or if you just catch the feeling that your companion is there watching you.

For forty years, a fisherman in China used a straight needle to fish with. Whenever someone asked him why he didn't  use a bent hook, the fisherman always replied, "You catch ordinary fish with a bent hook, but I will catch a great fish with my straight hook."

Finally, word of this reached the emperor, who decided to visit this foolish fisherman himself. After the emperor saw the man fishing with a straight needle, he asked, "What are you fishing for?"

The fisherman said: "I am fishing for you, Emperor."

While washinig the dishes one should only be washing the dishes, which means that while washing the dishes one should be completely aware of the fact that one is washing the dishes. At first glance, that might seem a little silly: Why put so much stress on such a simple thing? But that's precisely the point. The fact that I am standing there and washing these bowls is a wonderous reality. I'm being completely myself, following my breath, conscious of my thoughts and actions. There's no way I can be tossed around mindlessly like a bottle slapped here and there on the waves.

Just go in to the room and put one chair in the center. The the seat in the center of the room, open the doors and the windows, and see who comes to visit.

You will see it all arise and pass, and out of this, wisdom and understanding will come.

You can either be wise or you can know knowledge. But you can't know wisdom, you have to "be" it. Wisdom has simplicity to it. What the spiritual path offers is a way to come back into balance, to develop our intuition and the wisdom of our heart, so that the intellect is no longer the master, but instead is the servant of our heart... the part of us that brings us into unity with ourselves and all other beings.

All these [koans] are nonsense, that is, non-sense, and so is Zen. For sense is the product of reasoning and logic, of the laws of thought. Zen roars with laughter at all of them. Zen is the joke in a joke, and cannot, like a joke, be "explained."

There are many different metaphors for such a life. But the one that I have found most useful, and the most meaningful, comes from the kitchen.

We try so hard to hang on to the teachings and "get it," but actually the truth sinks in like rain into very hard earth. The rain is very gentle, and we soften up slowly at our own speed. But when that happens, something has fundamentally changed in us. That hard earth has softened. It doesn't seem to happen by trying to get it or capture  it. It happens by letting go; it happens by relaxing your mind, and it happens by the aspiration and the longing to want to communicate with yourself and others. Each one of us finds our own way.
