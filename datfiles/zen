Imagine two waves, a smaller one and a larger one, travelling across the ocean. Suddenly, the larger waves sees land approaching, and gets upset. He cries to the smaller wave, "Oh no! Up ahead - waves are crashing and disappearing! We're going to die!" The smaller wave, somehow, is unperturbed. So the larger wave tries to convince her, to no avail. Finally the smaller wave says, "What would you say if I told you that there are six words, that if you really understood and believed them, you would see that there's no reason to fear." The bigger wave protests, but as the land approaches, he becomes desperate. He'll try anything. "Fine, fine, tell me the six words." 

"Okay," the smaller wave says. "You're not a wave, you're water."

Then it is my turn.

Even if I replied, they would not understand.

Most of our difficulties, our hopes and our worries are empty fantasies. Nothing has ever existed except this moment. That's all there is. That's all we are.

We think about what has happened to us, what might have happened, how we feel about it, how we should be different, how others should be different, how it's all a shame, and on and on; it's all fantasy, all imagination. Memory is imagination. Every memory that we stick to devastates our life.

The True Man of ancient times knew nothing of loving life, knew nothing of hating death. He emerged without delight; he went back in without a fuss. He came briskly, he went briskly, and that was all. He didn't forget where he began; he didn't try to find out where he would end. He received something and took pleasure in it; he forgot about it and handed it back again. This is what I call not using the mind to repel the Way, not using man to help out Heaven.

Lung-ya asked the master, Te-shan, "If I threatened to cut your head off with the sharpest sword I could find, what would you do?"

The master pulled his head in.
Lung-ya said, "Your head is off!"
Later, Lung-ya came to Tung-shan and told of this episode.

Tung-shan asked, "What did Te-shan say?"

Lung-ya: "He said nothing!"
Tung-shan replied: "He said nothing? Then show me the head you cut off!"

Lung-ya acknowledged his fault and apologized. Later, someone reported the story back to Te-shan, who remarked, "Old Tung-shan has no judgement. That Lung-ya had been dead for some time - what is the use of trying to save him?"

Most people insist on some idea. Recently the younger generation talks about love. Love! Love! Love! Their minds are full of love! And when they study Zen, if what I say does not accord with the idea they have of love, they will not accept it. They are quite stubborn, you know. You may be amazed! Of course, not all, but some have a very, very hard attitude. That is not naturalness at all. Even though they talk about love, and freedom, or naturalness, they do not understand these things . And they cannot understand what Zen is in that way. If you want to study Zen, you should forget all your previous ideas and just practice zazen and see what kind of experience you have in your practice. That is naturalness.

I have found it helpful merely to *listen* to the breath, as the Zen-trained teacher Toni Packer advises, rather than employ an alalytic method. In the same spirit, one can view oneself not as the owner/operator of one's breathing but as the one "being breathed," both by one's body and by the life force common to all living beings. Approached in this way, the breath becomes an object of interest rather than willful concentration.

Use what you have, use what the world gives you. Use the first day of fall: bright flame before winter's deadness; harvest; orange, gold, amber; cool nights and the smell of fire.

Self-inquiry is simple. It only asks you to pay careful attention to what is true and real.

I have two songs. When they were about four, they both went through a phase of having nightmares. I would go into the room. Two small eyes blinked at me from the corner.

"What's the problem?" I'd ask.

"Daddy, there's a monster in the room." Now, I had more than one choice of how to respond... but the only real solution I ever found was to have a good look. Under the bed, in the closet, behind the curtains.

Eventually my sons would let out a deep sigh, smile at me, and fall back to sleep. The problem was not solved, but dissolved. It was never real in the first place, but it took investigation to make it a reality.

Spirituality is recognizing and celebrating that we are all inextricably connected to each other by a power greater than all of us, and that our connection to that power and to one another is grounded in love and compassion. Practicing spiritualaity brings a sense of perspective, meaning, and purpose to our lives.

The lesson which life repeats and constantly enforces is "look under foot." You are always nearer the divine and the true sources of your power than you think. The lure of the distant and difficult is deceptive. The great opportunity is where you are. Do not despise your own place and hour. Every place is under the stars, every place is of the world.

The naked moment is the only guide that we need to relax our mind. We need to trust this: in the midst of our daily life activities, the possibility to slow down, to stop, and then to appreciate naturally unfolds. For a fleeting moment we pause and note the sunlight on the sheets as we make the bed, note the warm sun on our cup as we sip tea, or note the fading light on the curtain as we enter the room. And we let out a breath or sigh. Pausing.

We try so hard to hang on to the teachings and "get it," but actually the truth sinks in like rain into very hard earth. The rain is very gentle, and we soften up slowly at our own speed.

It happens by letting go; it happens by relaxing your mind, and it happens by the aspiration and the longing to want to communicate with yourself and others. Each one of us finds our own way.

Actually there is no real teching at all for you to chew o. By not believeing in yourself, you pick up your baggage and go around to other people's houses looking for Zen, looking for Tao, looking for mysteries, looking for awakenings, looking for Buddhas, looking for masters, looking for teachers. You think this is searching for the ultimate and you make this into your religion. But this is like running blindly. The more you run, the further away you are. You just tire yourself, to what benefit in the end?

Four Zen pupils who were studying meditation had promised to observe a rule of silence for seven days. On the first day all were silent. The meditation session had begun well, but when night came and the oil lamps were burning dimly, one of the pupils finally could not help himself and said, "Someone should fix those lamps!"
The second pupil was shocked to hear him speak and cautioned him: "We are not supposed to say a word."

When we listen subconsciously to the sound of flowing water, does it not seem to create a rhythm? Yet not a single drop of water passes over  the same rock twice, and the murmur of water rushing over a rock is constantly changing. Sameness is but an illusion of the human ears, eyes, mind. Water that has flowed along a riverbed can never retrace its course. Human life is no different. It is only our mundane eyes and minds that see yesterday as the same as today.

We are living in a historical period in which we understand that it is necessary for all of us to be conscious and active in our world. None of us can ignore this call to action.

What we need is not more action, we need enlightened action. And this means letting go of action.

Zen is not about nonmovement.... Sitting is a centered, strong position in the midst of movement. When you get a top spinning just right, even though it is going very fast, it's so stable that it doesn't even look as if it's moving. If it's slightly off balance, it wobbles. It has to be centered and moving very fast in order to be stable. That's what Zen is all about.

It does not depend on the bow, but on the presence of mind, on the vitality and awareness with which you shoot..."

I never look at the masses as my responsibility; I look at the individual. I can only love one person at a time - just one, one, one. So you begin. I began - I picked up one person.

Just begin - one, one, one.
