Imagine two waves, a smaller one and a larger one, travelling across the ocean. Suddenly, the larger waves sees land approaching, and gets upset. He cries to the smaller wave, "Oh no! Up ahead - waves are crashing and disappearing! We're going to die!" The smaller wave, somehow, is unperturbed. So the larger wave tries to convince her, to no avail. Finally the smaller wave says, "What would you say if I told you that there are six words, that if you really understood and believed them, you would see that there's no reason to fear." The bigger wave protests, but as the land approaches, he becomes desperate. He'll try anything. "Fine, fine, tell me the six words." 

"Okay," the smaller wave says. "You're not a wave, you're water."

Then it is my turn.

Even if I replied, they would not understand.

Most of our difficulties, our hopes and our worries are empty fantasies. Nothing has ever existed except this moment. That's all there is. That's all we are.

We think about what has happened to us, what might have happened, how we feel about it, how we should be different, how others should be different, how it's all a shame, and on and on; it's all fantasy, all imagination. Memory is imagination. Every memory that we stick to devastates our life.

The True Man of ancient times knew nothing of loving life, knew nothing of hating death. He emerged without delight; he went back in without a fuss. He came briskly, he went briskly, and that was all. He didn't forget where he began; he didn't try to find out where he would end. He received something and took pleasure in it; he forgot about it and handed it back again. This is what I call not using the mind to repel the Way, not using man to help out Heaven.

Lung-ya asked the master, Te-shan, "If I threatened to cut your head off with the sharpest sword I could find, what would you do?"

The master pulled his head in.
Lung-ya said, "Your head is off!"
Later, Lung-ya came to Tung-shan and told of this episode.

Tung-shan asked, "What did Te-shan say?"

Lung-ya: "He said nothing!"
Tung-shan replied: "He said nothing? Then show me the head you cut off!"

Lung-ya acknowledged his fault and apologized. Later, someone reported the story back to Te-shan, who remarked, "Old Tung-shan has no judgement. That Lung-ya had been dead for some time - what is the use of trying to save him?"

One day, while Zen master Pao-chi was fanning himself, a monk approached and said, "Master, the nature of wind is permanent and there is no place it doesn't reach. Why do you need to fan yourself?"

The master replied: "You understand that the nature of wind is permanent, but you don't understand that it reaches everywhere."

"Then what does it mean that it reaches everywhere?"

The master just fanned himself.

Most people insist on some idea. Recently the younger generation talks about love. Love! Love! Love! Their minds are full of love! And when they study Zen, if what I say does not accord with the idea they have of love, they will not accept it. They are quite stubborn, you know. You may be amazed! Of course, not all, but some have a very, very hard attitude. That is not naturalness at all. Even though they talk about love, and freedom, or naturalness, they do not understand these things . And they cannot understand what Zen is in that way. If you want to study Zen, you should forget all your previous ideas and just practice zazen and see what kind of experience you have in your practice. That is naturalness.

If life doesn't turn out exactly as you planned, don't be surprised. Life is the great unknown. Even though we plan and scheme and make millinos of assumptions about the future, the truth is that we don't know what can happen in the next moment, let alone the next five weeks, months or years. So don't be surprised when things don't go according to your ideas, just relax and remember, life isn't personal, it's just life.

Sitting in an outhouse, I concentrated upon this doubt, and as time passed I forgot to leave. Suddenly a violent wind came, first blowing the outhose door open and then shut again with a loud crash.

I began to dance in a way I had never learned, and there are no words to convey my great joy.

I have found it helpful merely to *listen* to the breath, as the Zen-trained teacher Toni Packer advises, rather than employ an alalytic method. In the same spirit, one can view oneself not as the owner/operator of one's breathing but as the one "being breathed," both by one's body and by the life force common to all living beings. Approached in this way, the breath becomes an object of interest rather than willful concentration.

When we are mired in the relative world, never lifting our gaze to the mystery, our life is stunted, incomplete; we are filled with yearning for that paradise that is lost when, as young children, we replace with words and ideas and abstractions - such as merit, such as past, present, and future - our direct, spontaneaous experience fo the thing itself, in the beauty and precision of this present moment.

Use what you have, use what the world gives you. Use the first day of fall: bright flame before winter's deadness; harvest; orange, gold, amber; cool nights and the smell of fire. Our tree-lined streets are set ablaze, our kitchens filled with the smells of nostalgia: apples bubbling into sauce, roasting squash, cinnamon, nutmeg, cider, warmth itself. The leaves as they spark into wild color just before they die are the world's oldest performance art, and everything we see is celebrating one last violently hued hurrah before the black and white silence of winter.

"Becase I want to help human beings when I go back to Japan."

"For what?"

"Because it is helpful to human beings, who suffer so much."

"For what?"

"This is my way of life, to offer my life to all sentient beings. I want to help."

"For what?" the monk asked again. Finally, Dogen couldn't say anything.

Forget controlling our breath. We won't entirely forget, of course, but it's useless to contrl the breath. Instead, just experience it, which is very different.
