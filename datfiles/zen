Imagine two waves, a smaller one and a larger one, travelling across the ocean. Suddenly, the larger waves sees land approaching, and gets upset. He cries to the smaller wave, "Oh no! Up ahead - waves are crashing and disappearing! We're going to die!" The smaller wave, somehow, is unperturbed. So the larger wave tries to convince her, to no avail. Finally the smaller wave says, "What would you say if I told you that there are six words, that if you really understood and believed them, you would see that there's no reason to fear." The bigger wave protests, but as the land approaches, he becomes desperate. He'll try anything. "Fine, fine, tell me the six words." 

"Okay," the smaller wave says. "You're not a wave, you're water."

For a time, I play catch while the children sing;
Then it is my turn.
Playing like this, here and there, I have forgotten the time.

No answer I give, only a deep bow; 
Even if I replied, they would not understand.
Look around! There is nothing besides this.

When we are alone on a starlit night; when by chance we see the migrating birds in the autumn descending on a grove of junipers to rest and eat; when we see children in a moment when they are really children; when we know love in our own hearts; or when, like the Japanese poet, Basho, we hear an old frog land in a quiet pond with a solitary splash - at such times the awakening, the turning inside out of all values, the "newness," the emptiness and the purity of vision that make themselves evident, all these provide a glimpse of the cosmic dance.

Most of our difficulties, our hopes and our worries are empty fantasies. Nothing has ever existed except this moment. That's all there is. That's all we are. Yet most human beings spend 50 to 90 percent or more of their time in their imagination, living in fantasy. We think about what has happened to us, what might have happened, how we feel about it, how we should be different, how others should be different, how it's all a shame, and on and on; it's all fantasy, all imagination. Memory is imagination. Every memory that we stick to devastates our life.
