One day Te-shan gave a sermon, in which he said:

"When you question, you commit a fault. When you do not, you give offense."

A monk came forward and began to bow, whereupon the master struck him.

"I have just begun my bowing!" said the monk. "Why did you strike me?"

"If I wait for you to open your mouth, all will be over."

Imagine two waves, a smaller one and a larger one, travelling across the ocean. Suddenly, the larger waves sees land approaching, and gets upset. He cries to the smaller wave, "Oh no! Up ahead - waves are crashing and disappearing! We're going to die!" The smaller wave, somehow, is unperturbed. So the larger wave tries to convince her, to no avail. Finally the smaller wave says, "What would you say if I told you that there are six words, that if you really understood and believed them, you would see that there's no reason to fear." The bigger wave protests, but as the land approaches, he becomes desperate. He'll try anything. "Fine, fine, tell me the six words." 

"Okay," the smaller wave says. "You're not a wave, you're water."
--- Ram Dass
