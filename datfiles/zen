"If I wait for you to open your mouth, all will be over."

Imagine two waves, a smaller one and a larger one, travelling across the ocean. Suddenly, the larger waves sees land approaching, and gets upset. He cries to the smaller wave, "Oh no! Up ahead - waves are crashing and disappearing! We're going to die!" The smaller wave, somehow, is unperturbed. So the larger wave tries to convince her, to no avail. Finally the smaller wave says, "What would you say if I told you that there are six words, that if you really understood and believed them, you would see that there's no reason to fear." The bigger wave protests, but as the land approaches, he becomes desperate. He'll try anything. "Fine, fine, tell me the six words." 

"Okay," the smaller wave says. "You're not a wave, you're water."

For a time, I play catch while the children sing;
Then it is my turn.
Playing like this, here and there, I have forgotten the time.
Passers-by point and laugh at me, asking, "What is the reason for such foolishness?"
No answer I give, only a deep bow; 
Even if I replied, they would not understand.
Look around! There is nothing besides this.

When we are alone on a starlit night; when by chance we see the migrating birds in the autumn descending on a grove of junipers to rest and eat; when we see children in a moment when they are really children; when we know love in our own hearts; or when, like the Japanese poet, Basho, we hear an old frog land in a quiet pond with a solitary splash - at such times the awakening, the turning inside out of all values, the "newness," the emptiness and the purity of vision that make themselves evident, all these provide a glimpse of the cosmic dance.

There is something to be learned from a rainstorm. When meeting with a sudden shower, you try not to get wet and run quickly along the road. But doing such things as passing under the eves of houses, you still get wet. When you  are resolved from the beginning, you will not be perplexed, though you will still get the same soaking. This understanding extends to everything.

These are really the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands, they are not original with me,

The mountain of release is such that the ascent's most painful at the start, below; the more you rise, the milder it will be.

A person who is beginning to sense the suffering of life is, at the same time, beginning to awaken to deeper realities, truer realities.
