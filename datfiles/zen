Look at a tree, a flower, a plant. Let your awareness rest upon it. How still they are, how deeply rooted in Being. Allow nature to teach you stillness.

One day Te-shan gave a sermon, in which he said:

"When you question, you commit a fault. When you do not, you give offense."

A monk came forward and began to bow, whereupon the master struck him.

"I have just begun my bowing!" said the monk. "Why did you strike me?"

"If I wait for you to open your mouth, all will be over."

Imagine two waves, a smaller one and a larger one, travelling across the ocean. Suddenly, the larger waves sees land approaching, and gets upset. He cries to the smaller wave, "Oh no! Up ahead - waves are crashing and disappearing! We're going to die!" The smaller wave, somehow, is unperturbed. So the larger wave tries to convince her, to no avail. Finally the smaller wave says, "What would you say if I told you that there are six words, that if you really understood and believed them, you would see that there's no reason to fear." The bigger wave protests, but as the land approaches, he becomes desperate. He'll try anything. "Fine, fine, tell me the six words." 

"Okay," the smaller wave says. "You're not a wave, you're water."

For a time, I play catch while the children sing;
Then it is my turn.
Playing like this, here and there, I have forgotten the time.
Passers-by point and laugh at me, asking, "What is the reason for such foolishness?"
No answer I give, only a deep bow; 
Even if I replied, they would not understand.
Look around! There is nothing besides this.

When we are alone on a starlit night; when by chance we see the migrating birds in the autumn descending on a grove of junipers to rest and eat; when we see children in a moment when they are really children; when we know love in our own hearts; or when, like the Japanese poet, Basho, we hear an old frog land in a quiet pond with a solitary splash - at such times the awakening, the turning inside out of all values, the "newness," the emptiness and the purity of vision that make themselves evident, all these provide a glimpse of the cosmic dance.
--- Thomas Merton
